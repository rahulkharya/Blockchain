---- Decentralized Lottery Application ----

In this project, I am creating a smart contract on Ethereum Blockchain using Solidity and deploying it on Rinkeby test network.


---- Application Architecture & Workflow ----

- This application consists of manager and participants where, participants would be able to purchase one or more lotteries
  by transferring 2 ethers for each lottery.
- Ethers will be sent to the smart contract.
- Once the ethers are successfully submitted, the smart contract will provide lottery to the participants.
- Manager will be doing the supervision and will have full control over the transactions and activities

---- Prerequisite ----

- Participant must have a wallet
- A participant can transfer ether (i.e. purchase lottery) more than once but each time 2 ethers much be transferred
- Once a participant makes a transaction, its address will be registered
- Manager will have full control over the system
- The smart contract will reset once a round is completed (i.e. a winner is declared)
